# TODO - claude-worktree

This document tracks planned features, enhancements, and known issues for the claude-worktree project.

## High Priority

### Code Quality & Refactoring

- [ ] **Fix default AI tool configuration** (config.py:40)
  - Current: `"command": "claude-yolo"` (uses dangerous permissions by default)
  - Change to: `"command": "claude"` (safer default) or `"command": "no-op"` (let user choose)
  - File: `src/claude_worktree/config.py`
  - Impact: New users will have safer defaults
  - Related: Issue discovered during code review (2025-10-31)

## Medium Priority

### Code Quality & Refactoring (Critical Improvements)

- [ ] **Extract duplicated worktree resolution logic** (core.py - multiple functions)
  - Problem: Same 30-40 line pattern repeated in 7+ functions (finish_worktree, create_pr_worktree, delete_worktree, sync_worktree, change_base_branch, backup_worktree, resume_worktree)
  - Solution: Create `resolve_worktree_target(target: str | None) -> tuple[Path, str]` helper
  - Impact: Reduce ~150-200 lines of duplicated code, improve maintainability
  - Priority: High impact on code quality
  - File: `src/claude_worktree/core.py`
  - Lines affected: ~152-165, ~418-431, ~619-632, ~701-711, ~1578-1591, ~1822-1831, ~2130-2143
  - Testing: Ensure all affected commands still work correctly

- [ ] **Add branch name normalization utility** (git_utils.py)
  - Problem: `refs/heads/` prefix removal logic duplicated throughout codebase
  - Solution: Add `normalize_branch_name(branch: str) -> str` to git_utils.py
  - Current patterns:
    - `branch_name = target[11:] if target.startswith("refs/heads/") else target`
    - `if branch.startswith("refs/heads/"): branch_name = branch[11:]`
  - Impact: DRY principle, single source of truth for branch name handling
  - File: `src/claude_worktree/git_utils.py`
  - Refactor locations: core.py (10+ occurrences), cli.py (2 occurrences)

- [ ] **Extract worktree metadata retrieval helper** (core.py)
  - Problem: Metadata fetching logic repeated in finish_worktree, create_pr_worktree, merge_worktree
  - Solution: Create `get_worktree_metadata(branch: str, repo: Path) -> tuple[str, Path]` helper
  - Current pattern:
    ```python
    base_branch = get_config(CONFIG_KEY_BASE_BRANCH.format(feature_branch), worktree_repo)
    base_path_str = get_config(CONFIG_KEY_BASE_PATH.format(feature_branch), worktree_repo)
    if not base_branch or not base_path_str:
        raise GitError(f"Missing metadata for branch '{feature_branch}'...")
    ```
  - Impact: Consistent error handling, reduced duplication
  - File: `src/claude_worktree/core.py`
  - Testing: Verify error messages remain consistent

- [ ] **Consolidate duplicate imports** (cli.py:9-19)
  - Problem: Two separate import statements from same module `.config`
  - Solution: Merge into single import block
  - File: `src/claude_worktree/cli.py`
  - Impact: Code cleanliness, minor

- [ ] **Standardize error messages** (core.py)
  - Problem: Inconsistent error message formats for similar situations
  - Current variations:
    - `"No worktree found for branch '{target}'. Use 'cw list' to see available worktrees."`
    - `"No worktree found for branch '{branch}'. Try specifying the path directly."`
  - Solution: Define error message templates/constants
  - Impact: Better user experience, consistency
  - File: `src/claude_worktree/core.py` or new `src/claude_worktree/messages.py`
