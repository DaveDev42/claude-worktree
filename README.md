## Installation

### Using uv (recommended)

```bash
uv tool install claude-worktree
```

### Using pip

```bash
pip install claude-worktree
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DaveDev42/claude-worktree.git
cd claude-worktree
uv pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Create a new feature worktree

```bash
cw new fix-auth
```

This will:
- Create a new branch named `fix-auth`
- Create a worktree at `../myproject-fix-auth/`
- Launch Claude Code in that directory

### 2. Work on your feature

Make changes, commit them, and test your code in the isolated worktree.

### 3. Finish and merge

```bash
cw finish --push
```

This will:
- Rebase your feature onto the base branch
- Fast-forward merge into the base branch
- Clean up the worktree and feature branch
- Optionally push to remote with `--push`

## Usage

### Create a new worktree

```bash
# Create from current branch
cw new feature-name

# Specify base branch
cw new fix-bug --base develop

# Custom path
cw new hotfix --path /tmp/urgent-fix

# Launch Claude in iTerm (macOS)
cw new feature --iterm

# Launch Claude in tmux
cw new feature --tmux my-session
```

### List worktrees

```bash
cw list
```

Output:
```
Worktrees for repository: /Users/dave/myproject

BRANCH                              STATUS     PATH
refs/heads/main                     clean      .
refs/heads/fix-auth                 active     ../myproject-fix-auth
refs/heads/feature-api              modified   ../myproject-feature-api
```

**Status Types:**
- `active` (bold green) - Currently in this worktree directory
- `clean` (green) - No uncommitted changes
- `modified` (yellow) - Has uncommitted changes
- `stale` (red) - Directory deleted, needs `cw prune`

### Show status

```bash
cw status
```

### Resume AI work in a worktree

```bash
# Resume in current worktree
cw resume

# Resume in a specific worktree
cw resume fix-auth
```

### Delete a worktree

```bash
# Delete by branch name
cw delete fix-auth

# Delete by path
cw delete ../myproject-old-feature

# Keep branch, only remove worktree
cw delete feature --keep-branch

# Also delete remote branch
cw delete feature --delete-remote
```

### Prune stale worktrees

```bash
cw prune
```

Removes administrative data for worktrees with "stale" status (directories that have been manually deleted).

### Batch cleanup worktrees

```bash
# Delete merged worktrees
cw clean --merged

# Delete stale worktrees
cw clean --stale

# Delete worktrees older than 30 days
cw clean --older-than 30

# Interactive selection
cw clean -i

# Preview what would be deleted
cw clean --merged --dry-run
```

Use `--dry-run` to preview which worktrees would be deleted before actually removing them.

### Synchronize with base branch

```bash
# Sync current worktree
cw sync

# Sync specific worktree
cw sync fix-auth

# Sync all worktrees
cw sync --all

# Only fetch, don't rebase
cw sync --fetch-only
```

Fetches latest changes and rebases your feature branch onto the updated base branch. Useful for long-running features.

### Health check

```bash
cw doctor
```

Performs comprehensive health checks:
- Git version compatibility (minimum 2.31.0)
- Worktree accessibility (detects stale worktrees)
- Uncommitted changes detection
- Worktrees behind base branch
- Existing merge conflicts
- Cleanup recommendations

### Compare branches

```bash
# Full diff between branches
cw diff main feature-api

# Show diff statistics only
cw diff main feature-api --summary

# Show changed files list
cw diff main feature-api --files
```

### Visualize worktree hierarchy

```bash
cw tree
```

Displays an ASCII tree showing:
- Base repository at the root
- Feature worktrees as branches
- Status indicators (clean, modified, stale)
- Current worktree highlighting

### View statistics

```bash
cw stats
```

Shows comprehensive analytics:
- Total worktrees count and status distribution
- Age statistics (average, oldest, newest)
- Commit activity across worktrees
- Top 5 oldest worktrees
- Top 5 most active worktrees by commit count

### Template management

```bash
# Create template from current directory
cw template create my-python-setup

# Create with description
cw template create my-setup . -d "My project template"

# List all templates
cw template list

# Show template details
cw template show my-setup

# Apply template to current directory
cw template apply my-setup

# Apply to specific path
cw template apply my-setup ../feature

# Delete template
cw template delete my-setup
```

Templates help you reuse common worktree setups across projects.

### Stash management

```bash
# Save changes in current worktree
cw stash save
cw stash save "work in progress"

# List all stashes (organized by worktree)
cw stash list

# Apply stash to different worktree
cw stash apply fix-auth
cw stash apply feature-api --stash stash@{1}
```

Worktree-aware stashing makes it easy to move changes between worktrees.

### Finish with advanced options

```bash
# Interactive mode with confirmations
cw finish -i

# Preview merge without executing
cw finish --dry-run

# Get AI help with conflict resolution
cw finish --ai-merge

# Finish specific worktree from anywhere
cw finish fix-auth --push
```

The `--ai-merge` flag launches your configured AI tool if conflicts are detected during rebase.

cw --install-completion

# Restart your shell or source your config
```

Now you can use tab completion:
```bash
cw <TAB>          # Shows available commands
cw new --<TAB>    # Shows available options
```

## Shell Function for Quick Navigation

Install the `cw-cd` shell function to quickly navigate between worktrees:

```bash
# For bash/zsh
source <(cw _shell-function bash)

# For fish
cw _shell-function fish | source

# Add to your shell config for permanent installation
echo 'source <(cw _shell-function bash)' >> ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
```

Usage:
```bash
# Navigate to any worktree by branch name
cw-cd fix-auth
cw-cd feature-api

# Tab completion works too!
cw-cd <TAB>
```

## Configuration

### AI Tool Configuration

By default, `claude-worktree` launches Claude Code, but you can configure it to work with other AI coding assistants like Codex or Happy:

```bash
# Show current configuration
cw config show

# Set a custom AI tool
cw config set ai-tool claude
cw config set ai-tool codex
cw config set ai-tool "happy --backend claude"

# Use a predefined preset
cw config use-preset claude         # Claude Code (default)
cw config use-preset codex          # OpenAI Codex
cw config use-preset happy          # Happy with Claude Code
cw config use-preset happy-codex    # Happy with Codex mode
cw config use-preset happy-yolo     # Happy with bypass all permissions
cw config use-preset no-op          # Disable AI tool launch

# List available presets
cw config list-presets

# Reset to defaults
cw config reset
```

Configuration is stored in `~/.config/claude-worktree/config.json`.

#### Configuration Priority

1. Environment variable (`CW_AI_TOOL`)
2. Config file (`~/.config/claude-worktree/config.json`)
3. Default (`claude`)

Example using environment variable:
```bash
CW_AI_TOOL="aider" cw new feature-name
```

### Using Happy (Mobile Claude Code)

[Happy](https://github.com/slopus/happy-cli) is a mobile-enabled wrapper for Claude Code that allows you to control coding sessions from your phone.

#### Installation

```bash
npm install -g happy-coder
```

#### Quick Start

```bash
# Use Happy preset (Claude Code with mobile)
cw config use-preset happy

# Create worktree with Happy
cw new my-feature

# QR code will appear for mobile connection
```

#### Permission Modes

Happy supports different permission modes for faster iteration:

```bash
# Standard mode (default)
cw config use-preset happy

# Codex mode with bypass permissions
cw config use-preset happy-codex

# YOLO mode - bypass all permissions (fastest, use in sandboxes)
cw config use-preset happy-yolo
```

#### Using Happy with Codex

```bash
# Switch to Codex mode
cw config use-preset happy-codex
cw new my-feature
```

#### Advanced Configuration

```bash
# Custom Happy server
export HAPPY_SERVER_URL=https://my-server.com
cw config set ai-tool "happy"

# Pass additional arguments to Claude
cw config set ai-tool "happy --claude-arg --dangerously-skip-permissions"
```

### Custom AI Tools

You can use any AI coding assistant by setting a custom command:

```bash
# Set custom command
cw config set ai-tool "my-ai-tool --option value"

# Or use environment variable for one-time override
CW_AI_TOOL="aider" cw new my-feature
```

### Default Worktree Path

By default, `cw new <branch>` creates worktrees at:
```
../<repo-name>-<branch-name>/
```

For example, if your repository is at `/Users/dave/myproject` and you run `cw new fix-auth`:
- Worktree path: `/Users/dave/myproject-fix-auth/`
- Branch name: `fix-auth` (no timestamp)

### Launch Options

Control how the AI tool is launched when creating or resuming worktrees:

- `--bg`: Launch in background
- `--iterm`: Launch in new iTerm window (macOS only)
- `--iterm-tab`: Launch in new iTerm tab (macOS only)
- `--tmux <name>`: Launch in new tmux session

To skip AI tool launch entirely, use the `no-op` preset:
```bash
cw config use-preset no-op
```

### Auto-Update Settings

By default, `claude-worktree` checks for updates once per day. You can configure this behavior:

```bash
# Disable automatic update checks
cw config set update.auto_check false

# Re-enable automatic update checks
cw config set update.auto_check true

# Manual upgrade always works regardless of setting
cw upgrade
```

**When to disable auto-check:**
- Corporate environments with restricted internet
- Air-gapped systems
- CI/CD pipelines
- Personal preference for manual updates

**Note:** The `cw upgrade` command always works, even if auto-check is disabled.

## Requirements

- **Git**: Version 2.31 or higher
- **Python**: 3.11 or higher
- **AI Tool** (optional): Claude Code, Codex, Happy, or any custom AI coding assistant

## How It Works

### Metadata Storage

`claude-worktree` stores metadata in git config:

```bash
# Stores base branch for feature branches
git config branch.<feature>.worktreeBase <base>

# Stores path to main repository
git config worktree.<feature>.basePath <path>
```

This allows the `finish` command to know:
1. Which branch to rebase onto
2. Where the main repository is located
3. How to safely perform the merge

### Workflow Example

1. **Start**: You're on `main` branch in `/Users/dave/myproject`
2. **Create**: Run `cw new fix-auth`
   - Creates branch `fix-auth` from `main`
   - Creates worktree at `/Users/dave/myproject-fix-auth/`
   - Launches your configured AI tool (Claude Code by default)
3. **Work**: Make changes and commit in the worktree
4. **Finish**: Run `cw finish --push`
   - Rebases `fix-auth` onto `main`
   - Merges into `main` with fast-forward
   - Removes worktree and branch
   - Pushes to `origin/main`

## Troubleshooting

### "Not a git repository"

Make sure you're running commands from within a git repository.

### "AI tool not detected"

Install your preferred AI coding assistant:
- **Claude Code**: https://claude.ai/download
- **Codex**: Follow OpenAI's installation instructions
- **Happy**: npm install -g happy-coder

Or skip AI tool launch with the no-op preset:
```bash
cw config use-preset no-op
```

Alternatively, configure a different AI tool:
```bash
cw config set ai-tool <your-tool>
```

### "Rebase failed"

Conflicts were detected during rebase. You have two options:

**Option 1: AI-Assisted Resolution (Recommended)**
```bash
cw finish --ai-merge
```
If conflicts occur, your configured AI tool will launch to help resolve them.

**Option 2: Manual Resolution**
```bash
cd <worktree-path>
git rebase origin/<base-branch>
# Resolve conflicts
git rebase --continue
# Then run: cw finish
```

### Shell completion not working

1. Install completion: `cw --install-completion`
2. Restart your shell or source your config file
3. If still not working, check your shell's completion system is enabled
