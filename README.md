## What is Claude Worktree?

**claude-worktree** (or `cw` for short) is a CLI tool that makes it effortless to work on multiple git branches simultaneously using git worktrees, with automatic AI coding assistant integration. No more branch switching, stashing changes, or losing context‚Äîeach feature gets its own directory and AI session.

Works with Claude Code, Codex, Happy, and any custom AI tool.

### Key Features

- üå≥ **Easy Worktree Management**: Create isolated directories for each feature branch
- ü§ñ **Multi-AI Support**: Works with Claude Code, Codex, Happy, and custom AI tools
- üîÑ **Clean Merge Workflow**: Rebase, merge, and cleanup with a single command
- üîß **Health Monitoring**: Check worktree health, detect stale branches, and get recommendations
- üìä **Analytics & Visualization**: View statistics, tree hierarchy, and compare branches
- üéØ **AI-Assisted Workflows**: Get AI help with conflict resolution during merges
- üì¶ **Template System**: Save and reuse worktree setups across projects
- üíæ **Smart Stash Management**: Organize stashes by worktree for easy context switching
- üßπ **Batch Cleanup**: Clean up multiple worktrees based on merge status, age, or criteria
- ‚ö° **Shell Completion**: Tab completion for bash/zsh/fish with quick navigation
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Flexible Configuration**: Customize AI tool, presets, and defaults
- üé® **Type-Safe**: Built with type hints and modern Python practices

## Installation

### Using uv (recommended)

```bash
uv tool install claude-worktree
```

### Using pip

```bash
pip install claude-worktree
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DaveDev42/claude-worktree.git
cd claude-worktree
uv pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Create a new feature worktree

```bash
cw new fix-auth
```

This will:
- Create a new branch named `fix-auth`
- Create a worktree at `../myproject-fix-auth/`
- Launch Claude Code in that directory

### 2. Work on your feature

Make changes, commit them, and test your code in the isolated worktree.

### 3. Finish and merge

```bash
cw finish --push
```

This will:
- Rebase your feature onto the base branch
- Fast-forward merge into the base branch
- Clean up the worktree and feature branch
- Optionally push to remote with `--push`

## Usage

### Create a new worktree

```bash
# Create from current branch
cw new feature-name

# Specify base branch
cw new fix-bug --base develop

# Custom path
cw new hotfix --path /tmp/urgent-fix

# Launch Claude in iTerm (macOS)
cw new feature --iterm

# Launch Claude in tmux
cw new feature --tmux my-session
```

### List worktrees

```bash
cw list
```

Output:
```
Worktrees for repository: /Users/dave/myproject

BRANCH                              STATUS     PATH
refs/heads/main                     clean      .
refs/heads/fix-auth                 active     ../myproject-fix-auth
refs/heads/feature-api              modified   ../myproject-feature-api
```

**Status Types:**
- `active` (bold green) - Currently in this worktree directory
- `clean` (green) - No uncommitted changes
- `modified` (yellow) - Has uncommitted changes
- `stale` (red) - Directory deleted, needs `cw prune`

### Show status

```bash
cw status
```

### Resume AI work in a worktree

```bash
# Resume in current worktree
cw resume

# Resume in a specific worktree
cw resume fix-auth
```

### Delete a worktree

```bash
# Delete by branch name
cw delete fix-auth

# Delete by path
cw delete ../myproject-old-feature

# Keep branch, only remove worktree
cw delete feature --keep-branch

# Also delete remote branch
cw delete feature --delete-remote
```

### Prune stale worktrees

```bash
cw prune
```

Removes administrative data for worktrees with "stale" status (directories that have been manually deleted).

### Batch cleanup worktrees

```bash
# Delete merged worktrees
cw clean --merged

# Delete stale worktrees
cw clean --stale

# Delete worktrees older than 30 days
cw clean --older-than 30

# Interactive selection
cw clean -i

# Preview what would be deleted
cw clean --merged --dry-run
```

Use `--dry-run` to preview which worktrees would be deleted before actually removing them.

### Synchronize with base branch

```bash
# Sync current worktree
cw sync

# Sync specific worktree
cw sync fix-auth

# Sync all worktrees
cw sync --all

# Only fetch, don't rebase
cw sync --fetch-only
```

Fetches latest changes and rebases your feature branch onto the updated base branch. Useful for long-running features.

### Health check

```bash
cw doctor
```

Performs comprehensive health checks:
- Git version compatibility (minimum 2.31.0)
- Worktree accessibility (detects stale worktrees)
- Uncommitted changes detection
- Worktrees behind base branch
- Existing merge conflicts
- Cleanup recommendations

### Compare branches

```bash
# Full diff between branches
cw diff main feature-api

# Show diff statistics only
cw diff main feature-api --summary

# Show changed files list
cw diff main feature-api --files
```

### Visualize worktree hierarchy

```bash
cw tree
```

Displays an ASCII tree showing:
- Base repository at the root
- Feature worktrees as branches
- Status indicators (clean, modified, stale)
- Current worktree highlighting

### View statistics

```bash
cw stats
```

Shows comprehensive analytics:
- Total worktrees count and status distribution
- Age statistics (average, oldest, newest)
- Commit activity across worktrees
- Top 5 oldest worktrees
- Top 5 most active worktrees by commit count

### Template management

```bash
# Create template from current directory
cw template create my-python-setup

# Create with description
cw template create my-setup . -d "My project template"

# List all templates
cw template list

# Show template details
cw template show my-setup

# Apply template to current directory
cw template apply my-setup

# Apply to specific path
cw template apply my-setup ../feature

# Delete template
cw template delete my-setup
```

Templates help you reuse common worktree setups across projects.

### Stash management

```bash
# Save changes in current worktree
cw stash save
cw stash save "work in progress"

# List all stashes (organized by worktree)
cw stash list

# Apply stash to different worktree
cw stash apply fix-auth
cw stash apply feature-api --stash stash@{1}
```

Worktree-aware stashing makes it easy to move changes between worktrees.

### Finish with advanced options

```bash
# Interactive mode with confirmations
cw finish -i

# Preview merge without executing
cw finish --dry-run

# Get AI help with conflict resolution
cw finish --ai-merge

# Finish specific worktree from anywhere
cw finish fix-auth --push
```

The `--ai-merge` flag launches your configured AI tool if conflicts are detected during rebase.

cw --install-completion

# Restart your shell or source your config
```

Now you can use tab completion:
```bash
cw <TAB>          # Shows available commands
cw new --<TAB>    # Shows available options
```

## Shell Function for Quick Navigation

Install the `cw-cd` shell function to quickly navigate between worktrees:

```bash
# For bash/zsh
source <(cw _shell-function bash)

# For fish
cw _shell-function fish | source

# Add to your shell config for permanent installation
echo 'source <(cw _shell-function bash)' >> ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
```

Usage:
```bash
# Navigate to any worktree by branch name
cw-cd fix-auth
cw-cd feature-api

# Tab completion works too!
cw-cd <TAB>
```

## Configuration

### AI Tool Configuration

By default, `claude-worktree` launches Claude Code, but you can configure it to work with other AI coding assistants like Codex or Happy:

```bash
# Show current configuration
cw config show

# Set a custom AI tool
cw config set ai-tool claude
cw config set ai-tool codex
cw config set ai-tool "happy --backend claude"

# Use a predefined preset
cw config use-preset claude         # Claude Code (default)
cw config use-preset codex          # OpenAI Codex
cw config use-preset happy          # Happy with Claude Code
cw config use-preset happy-codex    # Happy with Codex mode
cw config use-preset happy-yolo     # Happy with bypass all permissions
cw config use-preset no-op          # Disable AI tool launch

# List available presets
cw config list-presets

# Reset to defaults
cw config reset
```

Configuration is stored in `~/.config/claude-worktree/config.json`.

#### Configuration Priority

1. Environment variable (`CW_AI_TOOL`)
2. Config file (`~/.config/claude-worktree/config.json`)
3. Default (`claude`)

Example using environment variable:
```bash
CW_AI_TOOL="aider" cw new feature-name
```

### Using Happy (Mobile Claude Code)

[Happy](https://github.com/slopus/happy-cli) is a mobile-enabled wrapper for Claude Code that allows you to control coding sessions from your phone.

#### Installation

```bash
npm install -g happy-coder
```

#### Quick Start

```bash
# Use Happy preset (Claude Code with mobile)
cw config use-preset happy

# Create worktree with Happy
cw new my-feature

# QR code will appear for mobile connection
```

#### Permission Modes

Happy supports different permission modes for faster iteration:

```bash
# Standard mode (default)
cw config use-preset happy

# Codex mode with bypass permissions
cw config use-preset happy-codex

# YOLO mode - bypass all permissions (fastest, use in sandboxes)
cw config use-preset happy-yolo
```

#### Using Happy with Codex

```bash
# Switch to Codex mode
cw config use-preset happy-codex
cw new my-feature
```

#### Advanced Configuration

```bash
# Custom Happy server
export HAPPY_SERVER_URL=https://my-server.com
cw config set ai-tool "happy"

# Pass additional arguments to Claude
cw config set ai-tool "happy --claude-arg --dangerously-skip-permissions"
```

### Custom AI Tools

You can use any AI coding assistant by setting a custom command:

```bash
# Set custom command
cw config set ai-tool "my-ai-tool --option value"

# Or use environment variable for one-time override
CW_AI_TOOL="aider" cw new my-feature
```

### Default Worktree Path

By default, `cw new <branch>` creates worktrees at:
```
../<repo-name>-<branch-name>/
```

For example, if your repository is at `/Users/dave/myproject` and you run `cw new fix-auth`:
- Worktree path: `/Users/dave/myproject-fix-auth/`
- Branch name: `fix-auth` (no timestamp)

### Launch Options

Control how the AI tool is launched when creating or resuming worktrees:

- `--bg`: Launch in background
- `--iterm`: Launch in new iTerm window (macOS only)
- `--iterm-tab`: Launch in new iTerm tab (macOS only)
- `--tmux <name>`: Launch in new tmux session

To skip AI tool launch entirely, use the `no-op` preset:
```bash
cw config use-preset no-op
```

### Auto-Update Settings

By default, `claude-worktree` checks for updates once per day. You can configure this behavior:

```bash
# Disable automatic update checks
cw config set update.auto_check false

# Re-enable automatic update checks
cw config set update.auto_check true

# Manual upgrade always works regardless of setting
cw upgrade
```

**When to disable auto-check:**
- Corporate environments with restricted internet
- Air-gapped systems
- CI/CD pipelines
- Personal preference for manual updates

**Note:** The `cw upgrade` command always works, even if auto-check is disabled.

## Requirements

- **Git**: Version 2.31 or higher
- **Python**: 3.11 or higher
- **AI Tool** (optional): Claude Code, Codex, Happy, or any custom AI coding assistant

## How It Works

### Metadata Storage

`claude-worktree` stores metadata in git config:

```bash
# Stores base branch for feature branches
git config branch.<feature>.worktreeBase <base>

# Stores path to main repository
git config worktree.<feature>.basePath <path>
```

This allows the `finish` command to know:
1. Which branch to rebase onto
2. Where the main repository is located
3. How to safely perform the merge

## Workflow Examples

### Basic Feature Development

The most common workflow for developing a single feature:

```bash
# 1. Create feature worktree
cw new add-user-auth

# 2. Work in the worktree (AI tool launches automatically)
# Make changes, commit as needed...

# 3. Finish and merge
cw finish --push
```

### Multi-Feature Parallel Development

Work on multiple features simultaneously without branch switching:

```bash
# Start three features in parallel
cw new feature-api
cw new fix-bug-123
cw new refactor-db

# Check status of all worktrees
cw list
cw tree

# Navigate between features
cw-cd feature-api    # Jump to feature-api worktree
cw-cd fix-bug-123    # Jump to bug fix worktree

# Resume AI work in specific feature
cw resume refactor-db

# Finish features as they're completed
cw finish feature-api --push
cw finish fix-bug-123 --push
```

### Team Collaboration Workflow

Collaborate with team members using shared remote branches:

```bash
# Create feature and push to remote
cw new team-feature
git push -u origin team-feature

# Team member pulls your worktree
cw new team-feature --base origin/team-feature

# Sync with latest changes from team
cw sync team-feature

# Or sync all your worktrees
cw sync --all

# Review changes before merging
cw diff main team-feature --summary
cw finish team-feature --dry-run

# Merge with AI assistance if conflicts arise
cw finish team-feature --ai-merge --push
```

### Long-Running Feature Branch

Maintain a long-lived feature branch while keeping it up-to-date:

```bash
# Start feature from develop branch
cw new big-refactor --base develop

# Work for a few days...
# Meanwhile, develop branch gets updates

# Stay synchronized with develop
cw sync big-refactor

# Or fetch without rebasing
cw sync big-refactor --fetch-only

# Check if you're behind
cw doctor

# Review changes before finishing
cw diff develop big-refactor --files
cw finish big-refactor -i --push  # Interactive mode
```

### Hotfix Workflow

Quickly create and deploy an urgent hotfix:

```bash
# Create hotfix from production branch
cw new hotfix-security --base production

# Make fix and test
# ...

# Merge to production
cw finish hotfix-security --push

# Also apply to main/develop
git checkout main
git cherry-pick hotfix-security
git push
```

### Experimentation & Clean Cleanup

Try experimental features and easily clean up:

```bash
# Create experimental worktrees
cw new experiment-approach-a
cw new experiment-approach-b
cw new experiment-approach-c

# After testing, keep only what works
cw delete experiment-approach-a
cw delete experiment-approach-b
cw finish experiment-approach-c --push

# Or use batch cleanup
cw clean --merged           # Remove already-merged features
cw clean --older-than 7     # Remove week-old experiments
cw clean --stale            # Remove deleted directories
```

### Using Templates for Consistency

Create and apply templates for common project setups:

```bash
# Create a template from current worktree
cd myproject-feature
cw template create python-api -d "Python API with tests"

# Apply template to new worktrees
cw new another-feature
cw template apply python-api

# Share templates across projects
cw template list
cw template show python-api
```

### Stash Management Across Worktrees

Move work-in-progress between worktrees:

```bash
# Working on feature-a, need to switch to urgent bug fix
cd myproject-feature-a
cw stash save "Half-done refactoring"

# Work on bug fix
cw resume fix-urgent-bug
# Fix bug...
cw finish fix-urgent-bug --push

# Return to original work
cw resume feature-a
cw stash list  # See all stashes by worktree
cw stash apply feature-a
```

### CI/CD Integration

Use `claude-worktree` in continuous integration pipelines:

```bash
# In CI pipeline script
# Disable AI tool and auto-updates
export CW_AI_TOOL="echo"  # No-op AI tool
cw config set update.auto_check false

# Create isolated test environment
cw new ci-test-${CI_BUILD_ID} --base ${CI_COMMIT_BRANCH}

# Run tests in worktree
cd ../repo-ci-test-${CI_BUILD_ID}
pytest

# Cleanup
cw delete ci-test-${CI_BUILD_ID}
```

### Code Review Workflow

Review pull requests in isolated worktrees:

```bash
# Fetch PR branch
git fetch origin pull/123/head:pr-123

# Create worktree for review
cw new review-pr-123 --base pr-123

# Review and test changes
cw diff main review-pr-123 --summary
cw diff main review-pr-123 --files

# Run tests in isolated environment
cd ../myproject-review-pr-123
npm test

# Clean up after review
cw delete review-pr-123
```

## Troubleshooting

For detailed troubleshooting, see [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

### Quick Solutions

### "Not a git repository"

Make sure you're running commands from within a git repository.

### "AI tool not detected"

Install your preferred AI coding assistant:
- **Claude Code**: https://claude.ai/download
- **Codex**: Follow OpenAI's installation instructions
- **Happy**: npm install -g happy-coder

Or skip AI tool launch with the no-op preset:
```bash
cw config use-preset no-op
```

Alternatively, configure a different AI tool:
```bash
cw config set ai-tool <your-tool>
```

### "Rebase failed"

Conflicts were detected during rebase. You have two options:

**Option 1: AI-Assisted Resolution (Recommended)**
```bash
cw finish --ai-merge
```
If conflicts occur, your configured AI tool will launch to help resolve them.

**Option 2: Manual Resolution**
```bash
cd <worktree-path>
git rebase origin/<base-branch>
# Resolve conflicts
git rebase --continue
# Then run: cw finish
```

### Shell completion not working

1. Install completion: `cw --install-completion`
2. Restart your shell or source your config file
3. If still not working, check your shell's completion system is enabled
